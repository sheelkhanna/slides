The best way to install Rust is with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). rustup is a Rust
version manager. To install it type:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

To keep your rust up-to-date with the latest stable version of rust,
type:

```
rustup update
```

To check which version of Rust you have type:

```
rustc --version
```
