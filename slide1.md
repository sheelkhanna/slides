### This guide is an intro to Rust syntax. It doesn't touch on concepts at all.

### Concepts are more important, but sometimes you need a little boost to get to a point where the concepts make sense.

## install rust

The best way to install Rust is with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). rustup is a Rust
version manager. To install it type:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

To keep your rust up-to-date with the latest stable version of rust,
type:

```
rustup update
```

To check which version of Rust you have type:

```
rustc --version
```
